## Simple Description
This is the second project of AI a Modern Approach Course, which represents Supervised Learning Feed Forward Neural Network.
The basic Idea of this project is to predict label (multi-class classification) from numerical values, I used such lables indicates shapes types in diffrent density areas on x, y Axis.
The goal metrics used is Sum Square Error with maximum number of epochs.
